**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Feature ID**: FEATURE-20250617-default-pay-rates  

## Overview
Successfully implemented a default pay rates system that allows users to set and manage default hourly pay rates for each job position. These defaults auto-populate when adding new employees, streamlining the employee creation process.

## Implementation Details

### 1. State Management (js/state.js)
- ✅ Added `defaultPayRates` object to main state structure
- ✅ Added `getDefaultPayRates()` function
- ✅ Added `setDefaultPayRate(position, rate)` function  
- ✅ Added `updateDefaultPayRates(newRates)` function
- ✅ Added `getDefaultPayRateForPosition(position)` function
- ✅ Updated `saveStateToLocalStorage()` to persist default pay rates
- ✅ Updated `loadStateFromLocalStorage()` to restore default pay rates

### 2. User Interface
- ✅ Added default pay rates section to Settings & Data Management (index.html)
- ✅ Created dedicated UI module (js/ui/ui-default-pay-rates.js)
- ✅ Added responsive CSS styling for pay rate inputs (css/styles.css)
- ✅ Added DOM element references (js/domElements.js)

### 3. Event Handling
- ✅ Added event listener for save button (js/events/events-initialization.js)
- ✅ Created handler function for saving pay rates
- ✅ Added UI initialization in main.js

### 4. Employee Management Integration
- ✅ Modified `renderEmpPositionsWithPayRates()` to use default pay rates
- ✅ Auto-populate pay rate fields when adding new employees
- ✅ Preserve existing pay rates when editing employees

### 5. Tutorial System
- ✅ Added tutorial steps for the new default pay rates feature
- ✅ Integrated with existing Settings & Data Management tutorial

## User Experience Flow

### Setting Default Pay Rates:
1. User opens Settings & Data Management section
2. User sees default pay rate inputs for each job position
3. User enters/modifies default rates and clicks "Save Default Pay Rates"
4. System saves rates to localStorage with visual feedback

### Using Default Pay Rates:
1. User clicks "Add New Jukebox Hero" to add an employee
2. User selects job positions for the employee
3. Pay rate fields automatically populate with default values
4. User can modify individual rates if needed
5. System saves both individual rates and preserves defaults

## Technical Features

### Data Persistence
- Default pay rates are saved to localStorage as `dinerTipSplit_defaultPayRatesV2`
- Automatic loading on application startup
- Integration with existing state management system

### Validation
- Input validation for pay rates (must be numeric, ≥ 0)
- Visual feedback for invalid inputs (red border)
- Success feedback when saving (button text change + color)

### Responsive Design
- Grid layout adapts to different screen sizes
- Consistent styling with existing UI components
- Proper labeling and accessibility features

## Testing
- ✅ Created test page (default-pay-rates-test.html)
- ✅ Verified state management functions work correctly
- ✅ Tested UI rendering and saving functionality
- ✅ Tested integration with employee management

## Default Values
The system initializes with these default pay rates:
- Server: $15.00/hr
- Busser: $12.00/hr  
- Shake Spinner: $13.00/hr
- Food Runner: $12.50/hr
- Host: $11.50/hr
