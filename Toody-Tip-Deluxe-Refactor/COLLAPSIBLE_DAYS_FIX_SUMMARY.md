# Collapsible Days Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The collapsible day functionality in the Weekly Rewind was not working correctly when the Weekly Rewind section was expanded on initial page load. Days with content were not starting expanded and the event listeners were not being attached properly.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Syntax Error**: Missing newline between console.log and addEventListener in ui-data-reports.js
2. **Timing Issues**: Event listeners were being attached with setTimeout(50ms) which was insufficient when the section was expanded immediately
3. **Missing Fallback**: No retry mechanism if DOM elements weren't ready when event listeners were being attached
4. **No Duplicate Prevention**: Event listeners could be attached multiple times
5. **No External Trigger**: No way to ensure event listeners were attached after content regeneration

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Syntax Error (js/ui/ui-data-reports.js)
- Fixed missing newline between console.log and header.addEventListener

### 2. Enhanced Event Listener Attachment (js/ui/ui-data-reports.js)
- Replaced setTimeout with requestAnimationFrame for better DOM readiness
- Added retry mechanism with maximum 3 attempts
- Added duplicate listener prevention using data-listener-attached attribute
- Enhanced logging for debugging

### 3. Added Public Function (js/ui/ui-data-reports.js)
- Created `ensureDayHeaderEventListeners()` function that can be called externally
- This provides a way to force event listener attachment after content updates

### 4. Added External Trigger (js/events/events-app-logic.js)
- Imported and called `ensureDayHeaderEventListeners()` after weekly report content generation
- Added 100ms delay to ensure DOM is ready

### 5. Added Mutation Observer (js/ui/ui-data-reports.js)
- Implemented MutationObserver to watch for changes in Weekly Rewind content
- Automatically triggers event listener attachment when content changes
- Prevents duplicate observers with data-observer-attached attribute

### 6. Reduced Debug Logging (js/ui/ui-data-reports.js)
- Removed excessive console logging while keeping essential debug information
- Cleaned up verbose logging about content state during toggling

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Scenario A - Weekly Rewind Starts Collapsed:**
   - Navigate to app with Weekly Rewind collapsed
   - Expand the Weekly Rewind section
   - Verify days with data are expanded and clickable

2. **Test Scenario B - Weekly Rewind Starts Expanded:**
   - Navigate to app with Weekly Rewind expanded (or refresh after expanding)
   - Verify days with data are expanded and clickable immediately
   - Verify all day headers respond to clicks

3. **Test Scenario C - Toggle Weekly Rewind:**
   - Collapse and re-expand the Weekly Rewind section
   - Verify days maintain correct state and functionality

## Expected Behavior
- Days with shift data should start expanded (display: block, aria-expanded: true, indicator: -)
- Days without shift data should start collapsed (display: none, aria-expanded: false, indicator: +)
- All day headers should be clickable to toggle their content
- Collapse indicator (+/-) should update correctly when toggled
- This should work regardless of whether Weekly Rewind starts expanded or collapsed

## Files Modified
- `js/ui/ui-data-reports.js` - Main collapsible day functionality
- `js/events/events-app-logic.js` - Added call to ensure event listeners
- `collapsible-days-test.html` - Test page for verifying functionality

## Debug Information
- Look for "UI_LOG:" messages in browser console
- Event listener attachment attempts and success/failure
- Day header click events and toggle operations
- Mutation observer activity

The fix uses multiple layers of reliability:
1. Primary: requestAnimationFrame + retry mechanism
2. Secondary: External trigger after content generation  
3. Tertiary: Mutation observer for content changes
4. Safety: Duplicate prevention and error handling
