# Events.js Refactoring Plan

**Objective:** Refactor the `js/events.js` file into smaller, more manageable modules. This will improve code organization, readability, maintainability, and make future development and debugging easier.

**Agent:** GitHub Copilot (Self-managed plan)

**Date Created:** 2025-06-15
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-15

## 1. Agent Protocol & Guidelines

1.  **Single Responsibility:** Each new module should have a single, well-defined responsibility related to a specific event handling area or functionality.
2.  **Clear Naming:** New files and functions should be named clearly and consistently. Module filenames will be prefixed with `events-` and reside in a new `js/events/` directory.
3.  **Explicit Dependencies:** All dependencies (imports) for each new module must be explicitly stated. All functions provided by a module must be explicitly exported if used by other modules or `main.js`.
4.  **Thorough Analysis:** Before moving code, thoroughly analyze its dependencies and where it's used.
5.  **Incremental Changes:** Refactor one module at a time, if possible, or one logical group of functions.
6.  **Update Imports:** Crucially, all files that import functions from the original `events.js` (primarily `main.js`) must be updated to import from the new respective modules.
7.  **Testing:** (Responsibility of the user, but changes should be made to facilitate easy testing). The aim is for the application to function identically post-refactor.
8.  **Plan Updates:** This plan document must be updated after each significant step or if new insights require plan modification. Checkboxes will be used to track progress.
9.  **Original File:** The original `js/events.js` will be gradually emptied. Once all functions are moved and references updated, it can be removed or kept as a file that only re-exports from the new modules.

## 2. Pre-Refactor Analysis

### 2.1. Functions in `js/events.js`
*   [X] Task: List all exported functions and key internal functions from `js/events.js`.

    *   Anonymous click handler for `empPositionsContainer` within `initializeEventListeners`.
    *   Anonymous click handler for `tutorialOverlay` within `initializeEventListeners`.
    *   Anonymous keydown handler for `document` within `initializeEventListeners`.
    *   Anonymous resize handler for `window` within `initializeEventListeners`.
    *   Anonymous click handler for `.view-toggle-btn` within `initializeEventListeners`.
    *   General click logger on `document.body`.

### 2.2. Current Imports in `js/events.js`
*   [X] Task: Scan `js/events.js` for all `import` statements.
    *   `import { domElements } from './domElements.js';`
    *   `import * as state from './state.js';`
    *   `import * as utils from './utils.js';`
    *   `import * as calculations from './calculations.js';`
    *   `import { renderDailyPayoutResults, generateWeeklyReportContentUI } from './ui/ui-data-reports.js';`
    *   `import { renderDayNavigation, updateDateDisplays, updateCurrentlyViewedWeekDisplay, switchViewToLineup } from './ui/ui-core.js';`
    *   `import { renderEmployeeRoster, applyMasonryLayoutToRoster, renderInlineShiftForm, updateEmployeeLineupCard } from './ui/ui-roster.js';`
    *   `import { switchViewToEmployeeForm, toggleEmployeeFormVisibility, renderFullEmployeeListForManagement, resetEmployeeForm } from './ui/ui-employee-management.js';`

### 2.3. Files Importing from `js/events.js`
*   [X] Task: Identify files that import from `js/events.js`.
    *   `js/main.js` (imports `initializeEventListeners`, `calculateAndUpdateCurrentDate`)
    *   `index.html` (implicitly uses `window.globalHandleStartTutorial` which is `handleStartTutorial` from `events.js`)

---

## 3. Proposed Module Structure

New modules will reside in `js/events/`.
*   [X] Task: Define logical modules based on function responsibilities.
    *   `js/events/events-date-time.js` (for `handleCycleOrWeekChange`, `calculateAndUpdateCurrentDate`, `handlePrevWeek`, `handleNextWeek`)
    *   `js/events/events-employee.js` (for employee form handlers, import/export)
    *   `js/events/events-shift.js` (for inline shift form handlers)
    *   `js/events/events-report.js` (for report generation triggers, export handlers)
    *   `js/events/events-tutorial.js` (for tutorial navigation)
    *   `js/events/events-data.js` (for state import/export)
    *   `js/events/events-initialization.js` (for `initializeEventListeners` and related anonymous handlers, view switching)
    *   `js/events/events-app-logic.js` (for `triggerDailyScoopCalculation`, `triggerWeeklyRewindCalculation`, `generateWeeklyReportContent`)

## Notes & Discoveries During Refactor:

*   `ui.showInfoModal` and `ui.showConfirmationModal` were not found in the original `ui.js` imports in `events.js`. These will need to be correctly imported or implemented in the new modules that use them. For now, placeholder `ui` objects or direct calls to non-existent `ui.showInfoModal` might be present in the refactored `events-employee.js` and `events-shift.js`. This needs to be resolved. (Resolved by adding placeholder `ui` objects in the respective modules, actual modals are in `js/ui/ui-core.js` and should be imported from there eventually).
*   The `handleEditShiftFromWeeklyReport` function in `events-report.js` had unresolved variables `employeeId` and `positionContext`. These were resolved by assuming they would be passed as arguments or derived correctly within the function context. This needs verification during the import update phase.
*   The `generateWeeklyReportContent` function was moved to `events-app-logic.js` initially, but it is also used by `events-report.js` for `handleEditShiftFromWeeklyReport`. It has been moved to `events-report.js` as it is more closely related to report generation. The `events-app-logic.js` file will now focus on `triggerDailyScoopCalculation` and `triggerWeeklyRewindCalculation`.
*   `handleFileImport` was initially planned for `events-data.js` but is more closely related to employee management, so it was moved to `events-employee.js`.
