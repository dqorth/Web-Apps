## Bug Description
The "how-to" tutorial buttons located within collapsible sections (e.g., "How to Use This Section") do not perform their intended action (e.g., display a modal with help, navigate to a tutorial section) when clicked.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Navigate to a section containing a "how-to" button (e.g., within a collapsible help section).
3. Click on one of these tutorial buttons.

## Expected Result
The button click should trigger the display of tutorial information or a related interactive guide.

## Actual Result
The buttons do not appear to do anything functional. The browser console logs the following message:
`index.html:237 APP_LOG: Clicked tutorial button, preventing collapse.`
This suggests an event listener is capturing the click but not executing the tutorial-specific logic, possibly only preventing the parent collapsible section from closing.

## Environment
- OS: All
- Browser: All
- Application Version: Refactor Phase

## Attachments/Screenshots
N/A

## Notes
The issue seems to be related to event handling for these specific buttons. The `preventDefault()` or `stopPropagation()` might be correctly preventing the collapse of the parent accordion/collapsible element, but the actual function to show the tutorial content is either missing or not being called.
