## Bug Description
The `handleLoadState` function in `js/events/events-data.js` is not implemented. When the user clicks the "Load Save Data" button and selects a file, a console warning "handleLoadState is not yet implemented." is logged, and no state is loaded.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the "Data Management" section.
2. Click the "Load Save Data" label/button.
3. Select a valid JSON state file when the file dialog appears.
4. Observe the browser's developer console.

## Expected Behavior
After selecting a valid JSON state file, the application state (employee roster, shifts) should be overwritten/updated with the data from the file, and the UI should refresh to reflect this new state.

## Actual Behavior
A console warning is logged: `events-data.js:52 handleLoadState is not yet implemented.` The application state remains unchanged.

## Affected Files
- js/events/events-data.js (contains the `handleLoadState` function)
- index.html (contains the "Load Save Data" button/input)
- js/state.js (will be affected by loading new state)

## Attempt Log
*This section is the living history of the bug, which you will maintain.*

**2025-06-16: Attempt 1 (Implemented)**
- **Action:** Implemented the `handleLoadState` function in `js/events/events-data.js`.
  - Added logic to read the selected file using `FileReader`.
  - Parsed the JSON content.
  - Validated the structure of the loaded data (presence of `employeeRoster` array and `dailyShifts` object).
  - Updated the application state by calling `setEmployeeRoster` and `setDailyShifts` from `js/state.js`.
  - Triggered a UI refresh by calling `calculateAndUpdateCurrentDate()` from `js/events/events-date-time.js`.
  - Added basic error handling using `try...catch` and `alert()` for user feedback.
  - Ensured the file input is reset after processing.
- **Result:** The function now successfully loads state from a JSON file. The roster and shifts are updated, and the UI reflects these changes. Basic error handling for invalid file type and parsing errors is in place.
- **Status:** Marked as Fixed.
