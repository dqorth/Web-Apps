# BUG-20250615-TypeError-parseDateToMDT-not-a-function

**Status:** Open
**Priority:** High
**Assigned to:** AI Refactor Agent
**Reported by:** User

## Description

After attempting to fix `BUG-20250615-TypeError-getDayOfWeekMDT-not-a-function` by adding `getDayOfWeekMDT` to `js/utils.js`, a new `TypeError` occurs during application initialization. The console indicates that `utils.parseDateToMDT` is not a function when called from `calculateAndUpdateCurrentDate` in `js/events/events-date-time.js`.

**Error Message:**
`events-date-time.js:28 Uncaught TypeError: utils.parseDateToMDT is not a function`
`    at calculateAndUpdateCurrentDate (events-date-time.js:28:37)`
`    at HTMLDocument.init (main.js:43:3)`

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Apply the fix for `BUG-20250615-TypeError-getDayOfWeekMDT-not-a-function` which involves adding `getDayOfWeekMDT` to `js/utils.js`.
2. Load the application.
3. Observe the console for the error during the `init` sequence.

## Expected Behavior

The application should correctly call `parseDateToMDT` from `js/utils.js` to parse date strings into MDT Date objects without errors.

## Actual Behavior

A `TypeError` is thrown, indicating that `utils.parseDateToMDT` is not recognized as a function at the point of invocation in `js/events/events-date-time.js`. This likely halts further script execution related to date initialization.

## Impact

Prevents correct parsing and handling of dates in MDT, which is crucial for initializing the application state and UI. This is a regression caused by a fix for a previous bug.
