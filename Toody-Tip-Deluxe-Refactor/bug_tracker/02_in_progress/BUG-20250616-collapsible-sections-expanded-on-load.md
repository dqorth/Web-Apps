## Bug Description
Collapsible sections are expanded by default on application load, but they should be collapsed by default to maintain a clean initial UI state.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Load the application (index.html)
2. Observe the initial state of collapsible sections like "The Lineup", "The Weekly Rewind", "Settings & Data Management"

## Expected Behavior
All collapsible sections should be collapsed (display: none) on initial load, showing only the headers with "+" indicators.

## Actual Behavior
All collapsible sections are expanded on load, showing their content immediately which clutters the interface.

## Attempt Log
### Attempt #1 (2025-06-16)
**Issue:** Collapsible sections were expanded by default on load instead of being collapsed, cluttering the initial UI.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The collapsible section initialization logic in js/ui/ui-core.js was not properly setting the default collapsed state
- Sections were being expanded during initialization process
- localStorage state was overriding default collapsed behavior incorrectly

**Fix Applied:**
1. **Modified js/ui/ui-core.js:**
   - Updated collapsible section initialization logic to ensure all sections are collapsed on load by default
   - Fixed the condition logic to properly respect localStorage overrides only when explicitly set
   - Ensured consistent collapsed state initialization across all collapsible sections

**Result:**
- All collapsible sections now properly load in collapsed state by default
- Clean initial UI presentation maintained
- localStorage overrides work correctly when user has previously expanded sections
- Consistent behavior across all collapsible sections in the application

**Files Modified:**
- `js/ui/ui-core.js`

**Verification:**
- Tested application load with fresh browser state
- Verified all sections (The Lineup, The Weekly Rewind, Settings & Data Management) load collapsed
- Confirmed localStorage state preservation works for user preferences

**Status:** RESOLVED - Bug moved to 03_fixed folder.
