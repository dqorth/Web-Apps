id: BUG-20250610-inline-script-collapsible-sections
title: Inline script for collapsible sections in index.html
status: open
severity: low
date_reported: 2025-06-10
reporter: Copilot
assigned_to: Unassigned
description: |
  The `index.html` file contains an inline script for `initializeCollapsibleSections`. This might deviate from the modular refactoring goal if this functionality is intended to be part of the JavaScript modules. Consider moving this to an appropriate JS module (e.g., `ui.js` or `events.js`) and calling it from `main.js`.
steps_to_reproduce: |
  1. Inspect the `<body>` section of `index.html` towards the end.
  2. Observe the inline `<script>` tag containing the `initializeCollapsibleSections` function and its call.
expected_behavior: |
  All JavaScript logic, including UI interactions like collapsible sections, should be handled by external JS modules as per the refactoring goals to maintain separation of concerns and modularity.
actual_behavior: |
  An inline script handles the collapsible sections functionality.
affected_files:
  - index.html
  - js/ui.js (potential)
  - js/events.js (potential)
  - js/main.js (potential)
