## Bug Description
The Weekly Report Export to Excel button is visible and has click handler attached, but the actual Excel export functionality is not implemented. Clicking the button does not download an Excel file.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Add shift data for multiple days to make export button visible
2. Navigate to "The Weekly Rewind" section
3. Click the "Export This Week" button
4. Observe that no Excel file is downloaded

## Expected Behavior
Clicking the export button should generate and download an Excel (.xlsx) file containing the weekly report data with proper formatting and calculations.

## Actual Behavior
Button click only logs a console warning: "handleExportToXLSX is not yet implemented." No file is generated or downloaded.

**Attempt 2025-06-16 16:55** - By: AI - **Result:** Bug Identified
> **Action Taken:**
> Created new bug report to track the missing Excel export functionality. Identified that the infrastructure is in place (button visibility, click handler, event binding) but the actual handleExportToXLSX function is only a placeholder.
> 
> **Reasoning:**
> This is a separate issue from the button visibility bug which has been resolved. The export functionality requires implementing Excel generation using SheetJS library and proper data formatting for download.
