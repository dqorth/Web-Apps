## Bug Description
The function `triggerDailyScoopCalculation` is not defined, leading to an error when certain UI elements that depend on it are interacted with. Specifically, this error occurs when the "payoutContent" collapsible section in `index.html` is expanded.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Load `index.html`.
2. Click on the header for the "Daily Scoop" section (which has `aria-controls="payoutContent"`) to expand it.
3. Observe the JavaScript console for the error: `(index):266 Error: triggerDailyScoopCalculation function is not defined.`

## Expected Behavior
When the "Daily Scoop" section is expanded, the `triggerDailyScoopCalculation` function should be called without error, presumably to update or display data relevant to that section.

## Actual Behavior
An error `(index):266 Error: triggerDailyScoopCalculation function is not defined.` is thrown in the console. The content of the "Daily Scoop" section may not load or update correctly.
