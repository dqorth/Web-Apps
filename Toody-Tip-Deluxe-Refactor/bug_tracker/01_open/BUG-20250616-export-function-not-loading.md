Status: Open
Date Reported: 2025-06-16

## Bug Description
The Excel export functionality is still showing the old placeholder message "handleExportToXLSX is not yet implemented" despite the function being fully implemented in events-data.js. This suggests either a browser caching issue, module loading problem, or that the implementation is not being loaded correctly.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Navigate to "The Weekly Rewind" section
3. Add sufficient data to make the export button visible
4. Click the "Export This Week" button
5. Check browser console

## Expected Result
- Console should show "APP_LOG: Starting Excel export..."
- Excel file should be generated and downloaded
- No error messages about unimplemented functions

## Actual Result
- Console shows: "handleExportToXLSX is not yet implemented."
- Error location: events-data.js:9
- No Excel file is generated

## Environment
- OS: Windows
- Browser: All (likely browser caching issue)
- Application Version: Refactor Phase

## Console Output
```
events-initialization.js:133 DEBUG_CLICK_LISTENER: [js/events/events-initialization.js] document.body click detected. Target: 
events-data.js:9 handleExportToXLSX is not yet implemented.
handleExportToXLSX	@	events-data.js:9
```

## Notes
The function implementation exists in the file but seems to not be loading. Possible causes:
1. Browser caching old version of the file
2. Module import/export issue
3. Syntax error preventing file from loading properly
4. File not being served correctly
