id: BUG-20250610-state-management-structure-deviation
title: State management structure deviation in js/state.js
status: open
severity: low
date_reported: 2025-06-10
reporter: Copilot
assigned_to: Unassigned
description: |
  The `js/state.js` module exports `employeeRoster` and `dailyShifts` as separate, top-level `let` variables. The `REFACTORING_SPECIFICATION.MD` (Section 1.1 "Core State") specifies these should be properties of a single, unified `state` object (e.g., `state.employeeRoster`, `state.dailyShifts`).
steps_to_reproduce: |
  1. Review the code in `c:\Users\orthd\OneDrive\Documents\CodeMonkeez\Projects\Toody-Tip-Deluxe-Refactor\js\state.js`.
  2. Compare its export structure with the `REFACTORING_SPECIFICATION.MD` document, specifically Section 1.1 "Core State".
expected_behavior: |
  The `js/state.js` module should define and manage `employeeRoster` and `dailyShifts` as properties within a single `state` object, as outlined in the specification: `let state = { employeeRoster: [], dailyShifts: {} };`. Access to these state properties would then occur through this unified `state` object.
actual_behavior: |
  In `js/state.js`, `employeeRoster` and `dailyShifts` are exported as individual `let` variables (e.g., `export let employeeRoster = ...;`, `export let dailyShifts = ...;`), rather than being part of a singular `state` object.
