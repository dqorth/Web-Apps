## Issue Description
User reported a discrepancy in wage calculation where:
- Employee: Calimbo
- Pay Rate: $15/hr
- Shift Hours Displayed: 6.33 hrs
- Expected Wage: 6.33 × $15 = $94.95
- Actual Wage Shown: $95.00

User questioned whether there was a rounding error in the wage calculation.

## Investigation Results

### Root Cause Analysis
After thorough investigation, this is **NOT a bug** but rather correct mathematical behavior with display rounding.

**What's Actually Happening:**
1. **Time Calculation**: The shift that displays as "6.33 hrs" is actually 6 hours and 20 minutes
2. **Precise Hours**: 380 minutes ÷ 60 = 6.333... hours (exactly 6⅓ hours, repeating decimal)
3. **Wage Calculation**: 6.333... × $15 = $95.00 (mathematically exact)
4. **Display Rounding**: Hours displayed as `hoursWorked.toFixed(2)` = 6.33 (rounded for readability)

### Mathematical Verification
```
Time: 9:00 AM to 3:20 PM = 380 minutes
Exact Hours: 380 ÷ 60 = 6.33333... hours
Exact Wage: 6.33333... × $15 = $95.00
Display Hours: 6.33333...toFixed(2) = "6.33"
```

### Code Analysis
**Calculation Logic (js/calculations.js):**
```javascript
const exactHours = calculateHoursWorked(s.timeIn, s.timeOut); 
const wage = exactHours * (s.shiftPayRate || 0);
```

**Display Logic (js/ui/ui-data-reports.js):**
```javascript
<td data-label="Hrs">${pShift.hoursWorked.toFixed(2)}</td>
<td data-label="Wage">$${pShift.shiftWage.toFixed(2)}</td>
```

## Technical Details

### Time Precision
- **Internal Calculation**: Uses full floating-point precision (6.333... hours)
- **Display**: Rounds to 2 decimal places (6.33 hours) for UI readability
- **Result**: Wage calculation is mathematically accurate

### Business Logic Correctness
- The system correctly calculates wages based on actual time worked
- Display rounding is appropriate for user interface clarity
- No money is lost or gained - the calculation is precise

## Resolution

**Status: Resolved - Not a Bug**

This behavior is **mathematically correct and by design**:

1. ✅ **Accurate Time Tracking**: System tracks exact minutes worked
2. ✅ **Precise Wage Calculation**: Uses full precision for monetary calculations
3. ✅ **Appropriate Display**: Rounds hours for readability while maintaining calculation accuracy
4. ✅ **Fair Compensation**: Employees receive accurate pay for exact time worked

### User Education
When a shift shows "6.33 hours" but the wage calculates to $95.00:
- The actual time worked is 6⅓ hours (6.333... repeating)
- This is exactly 6 hours and 20 minutes
- The wage calculation of $95.00 is mathematically correct
- The "6.33" display is rounded for readability

## Recommendation
**No code changes required.** The system is working correctly and follows proper financial calculation practices by:
- Using full precision for monetary calculations
- Applying appropriate rounding only for display purposes
- Ensuring accurate compensation

## Additional Notes
This type of "apparent discrepancy" is common in financial software where:
- Display values are rounded for user interface clarity
- Internal calculations maintain full precision for accuracy
- The result appears inconsistent but is mathematically sound

**Example Time Ranges That Produce This Pattern:**
- 9:00 AM - 3:20 PM = 6.333... hrs × $15 = $95.00 (displays as 6.33 hrs)
- Any shift that is exactly 6 hours and 20 minutes will show this pattern

**Resolution:** Verified as correct behavior. No action required.
