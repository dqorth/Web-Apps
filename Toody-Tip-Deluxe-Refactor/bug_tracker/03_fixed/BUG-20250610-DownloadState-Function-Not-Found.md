title: Error when clicking "Download Save Data" - Function Not Implemented
status: fixed
severity: medium
date_reported: 2025-06-10
reporter: Copilot (originally), User
assigned_to: Unassigned
description: |
  Originally, an error was produced when clicking the "Download Save Data" button, suggesting the handler function was not found.
  After refactoring, the function `handleDownloadState` now exists in `js/events/events-data.js`, but it is not fully implemented.
  Clicking the "Download Save Data" button now results in a console error: "handleDownloadState is not yet implemented."
steps_to_reproduce: |
  1. Navigate to the "Data Management" section.
  2. Click the "Download Save Data" button.
  3. Observe the browser's developer console.
expected_behavior: |
  Clicking "Download Save Data" should trigger a download of the application's current state as a JSON file.
actual_behavior: |
  A console error is logged: `events-data.js:20 handleDownloadState is not yet implemented.` No download occurs.
affected_files:
  - js/events.js (Original location of event handlers)
  - js/events/events-data.js (New location of `handleDownloadState`)
  - index.html (Contains the button)
related_issues:
  - None

## Attempt Log
*This section is the living history of the bug, which you will maintain.*

### Original Issue (Pre-Refactor)
The `handleDownloadState` function was likely missing or not correctly wired up in `js/events.js`.

### Post-Refactoring Update (2025-06-15)
The `handleDownloadState` function has been moved to `js/events/events-data.js` as part of the events system refactoring.
The function is now correctly referenced by the event listener.
However, the function's implementation is currently a placeholder that logs an error message to the console indicating it's not yet implemented.

The bug is updated to reflect the current error: the function exists but lacks implementation.
The path to the relevant function is `js/events/events-data.js` at line 20 (or as indicated in the console error).

### Attempt [2025-06-15 17:30] - By: AI - **Result:** Success
> **Action Taken:**
> Implemented the `handleDownloadState` function in `js/events/events-data.js`. The function now performs the following steps:
>   1. Imports `employeeRoster` and `dailyShifts` from `../state.js`.
>   2. Creates a `stateToSave` object containing these two pieces of state.
>   3. Converts `stateToSave` to a pretty-printed JSON string using `JSON.stringify()`.
>   4. Creates a `Blob` with the JSON data and `type: 'application/json'`.
>   5. Generates a temporary URL for the `Blob` using `URL.createObjectURL()`.
>   6. Dynamically creates an `<a>` element.
>   7. Sets the `href` of the anchor to the blob URL.
>   8. Sets the `download` attribute of the anchor to a filename formatted as `toody_tip_deluxe_data_YYYY-MM-DD.json`.
>   9. Appends the anchor to the document body, programmatically clicks it to trigger the download, and then removes the anchor.
>   10. Revokes the object URL using `URL.revokeObjectURL()`.
>   11. Includes basic console logging for success and a try-catch block for error handling.
>
> **Reasoning:**
> The function was previously a placeholder. The implementation follows standard browser procedures for creating and triggering the download of a client-generated file. It directly accesses the necessary state variables (`employeeRoster`, `dailyShifts`) as per the application's structure and formats them into the required JSON output for backup purposes.
