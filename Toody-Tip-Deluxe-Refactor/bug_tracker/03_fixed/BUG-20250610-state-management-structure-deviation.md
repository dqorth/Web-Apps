title: State management structure deviation in js/state.js
status: fixed
severity: low
date_reported: 2025-06-10
reporter: Copilot
assigned_to: Unassigned
date_fixed: 2025-06-16
description: |
  The `js/state.js` module previously exported `employeeRoster` and `dailyShifts` as separate, top-level `let` variables. Per the refactoring specification, these are now unified as properties of a single exported `state` object. All references throughout the codebase have been updated to use this unified state structure. The UI and all dependent logic now function as expected, and no regressions or errors remain after testing.
steps_to_reproduce: |
  1. Review the code in `js/state.js`.
  2. Confirm that `employeeRoster`, `dailyShifts`, and other core state are properties of a single `state` object.
  3. Confirm all references in the codebase use the unified state object.
expected_behavior: |
  The `js/state.js` module defines and manages all core state as properties within a single `state` object, as outlined in the specification. All state access and mutation occurs through this object.
actual_behavior: |
  (Fixed) All state is now unified under the `state` object and all code references are updated accordingly.

  - js/state.js
  - all modules referencing state
