## Bug Description
Tutorial text boxes are teleporting to their new positions instead of smoothly animating like the highlight boxes. The highlight boxes have smooth, sleek animations when repositioning, but the text boxes instantly jump to their new location, creating a jarring user experience.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start any tutorial in the application
2. Scroll the page or resize the window during the tutorial
3. Observe that highlight boxes smoothly animate to their new positions
4. Observe that text boxes instantly teleport/jump to their new positions without animation

## Expected Result
Tutorial text boxes should have smooth CSS transitions/animations when repositioning, similar to the highlight boxes, providing a cohesive and polished user experience.

## Actual Result
Text boxes instantly teleport to their new positions without any animation or transition effects, creating a disjointed experience compared to the smooth highlight box animations.

## Environment
- OS: All
- Browser: All
- Application Version: Refactor Phase

## Attachments/Screenshots
N/A

## Notes
This affects the overall polish and user experience of the tutorial system. The highlight boxes already have the desired smooth animation behavior that should be replicated for text boxes.

## Attempt Log
**Attempt 2025-06-16 18:45** - By: AI - **Result:** Root Cause Identified
> **Action Taken:**
> Investigated the tutorial positioning system and CSS transitions. Found that:
> 
> 1. ✅ CSS transitions are properly defined in `css/styles.css`:
>    - `#tutorial-highlight-box`: `transition: top 0.3s ease-in-out, left 0.3s ease-in-out, width 0.3s ease-in-out, height 0.3s ease-in-out, box-shadow 0.3s ease-in-out;`
>    - `#tutorial-text-box`: `transition: top 0.3s ease-in-out, left 0.3s ease-in-out, opacity 0.3s ease-in-out, transform 0.3s ease-in-out;`
> 
> 2. ❌ Problem found in `js/ui/ui-tutorial.js` in `positionTextBox()` function:
>    - Function explicitly clears positioning properties: `textBox.style.left = ''; textBox.style.top = '';`
>    - This breaks the CSS transitions by removing and immediately re-setting the properties
>    - `positionHighlightBox()` doesn't have this clearing behavior, which is why it animates smoothly
> 
> **Root Cause:**
> The `positionTextBox` function resets positioning properties to empty strings before setting new values, which interrupts the CSS transition. The highlight box doesn't do this clearing, so its transitions work properly.
> 
> **Attempt 2025-06-16 18:50** - By: AI - **Result:** Fix Implemented
> **Action Taken:**
> Fixed the tutorial text box animation issue by modifying the `positionTextBox()` function in `js/ui/ui-tutorial.js`:
> 
> **Changes Made:**
> 1. **Removed Property Clearing:** Eliminated the lines that explicitly cleared positioning properties:
>    ```javascript
>    // REMOVED - These lines were breaking CSS transitions:
>    // textBox.style.left = '';
>    // textBox.style.top = '';
>    // textBox.style.right = '';
>    // textBox.style.bottom = '';
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Preserved CSS Transitions:** Function now sets new position values directly without clearing, allowing the CSS transitions defined in `css/styles.css` to animate smoothly between old and new positions.
> 
> 3. **Consistent with Highlight Box:** Now matches the approach used in `positionHighlightBox()` which already worked correctly.
> 
> **Technical Details:**
> - CSS transitions for `#tutorial-text-box` include: `top 0.3s ease-in-out, left 0.3s ease-in-out, opacity 0.3s ease-in-out, transform 0.3s ease-in-out`
> - By not clearing properties, the browser can smoothly transition from current values to new values
> - Text boxes now animate with the same smooth 0.3 second ease-in-out transition as highlight boxes
> 
> **Files Modified:**
> - `js/ui/ui-tutorial.js` - `positionTextBox()` function
> 
> **Result:**
> Tutorial text boxes now smoothly animate when repositioning during scroll/resize, providing a consistent and polished user experience matching the highlight box animations.

**Attempt 2025-06-16 18:52** - By: AI - **Result:** SUCCESSFUL ✅
> **Testing Steps:**
> 1. ✅ Syntax validation - No errors in modified function
> 2. ✅ Logic verification - Positioning calculation preserved, only property clearing removed
> 3. ✅ CSS verification - Transitions properly defined in styles.css
> 4. ✅ Consistency check - Now matches positionHighlightBox approach
> 5. ✅ **USER CONFIRMATION** - User tested after hard refresh and confirmed fix works correctly
> 
> **User Feedback:** "After hard refreshing, the fix did actually work. Thank you."
> 
> **Final Result:** 
> ✅ Tutorial text boxes now have smooth animations matching highlight boxes
> ✅ No more teleporting/jumping behavior 
> ✅ Consistent and polished user experience achieved
> 
> **Status:** RESOLVED - User confirmed fix is working correctly
