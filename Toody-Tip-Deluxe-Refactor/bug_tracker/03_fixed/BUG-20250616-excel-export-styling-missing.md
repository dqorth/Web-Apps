Status: In Progress
Date Reported: 2025-06-16
Date Updated: 2025-06-16
Reported By: User

## Bug Description
The Excel export function successfully generates and downloads Excel files with correct data, but the exported spreadsheets lack visual styling such as:
- Header row formatting (red background, white text, bold)
- Cell borders
- Zebra striping (alternating row colors)
- Professional visual appearance

The exported Excel files appear as plain, unformatted spreadsheets despite styling code being present in the implementation.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open `index.html` and navigate to "The Weekly Rewind" section
2. Ensure there's data for the current week (add shifts if needed)
3. Click "Export This Week" button
4. Open the downloaded Excel file
5. Observe that the spreadsheet has no visual formatting

## Expected Result
- Header row should have red background with white, bold text
- All cells should have thin borders
- Data rows should have alternating background colors (zebra striping)
- Professional, formatted appearance similar to business reports

## Actual Result
- Excel file contains correct data but appears as plain, unformatted spreadsheet
- No colors, borders, or visual styling applied
- Headers look identical to data rows

## Environment
- OS: Windows
- Browser: All browsers affected
- SheetJS Version: 0.18.5 (Community Edition from CDN)
- Export Format: XLSX

## Technical Analysis
**Root Cause:** SheetJS Community Edition (free version) has limited styling support. The styling properties being applied in the code are not supported in the free/CDN version.

**Evidence:**
- Styling code is correctly implemented in `js/events/events-data.js`
- No errors in console during export
- Data export works perfectly, only styling is missing
- Research confirms Community Edition lacks visual styling features

## Solution Options Evaluated

### Option 1: SheetJS Pro License (Not Implemented)
**Pros:** Full styling support, professional appearance
**Cons:** Requires paid license, additional cost
**Status:** Not cost-effective for this project

### Option 2: Alternative Library (Not Implemented)
**Pros:** May have better free styling support
**Cons:** Requires complete rewrite of export functionality
**Status:** Too much development overhead

### Option 3: Enhanced Data Formatting (Implemented ✅)
**Pros:** Improves readability without visual styling, works with free SheetJS
**Cons:** No visual colors/borders, but professional data formatting
**Status:** Chosen solution - provides best balance

### Option 4: Document Limitation (Implemented ✅)
**Pros:** Transparent about technical constraints
**Cons:** No visual improvement
**Status:** Included as part of solution documentation
